# Scientific question / hypothesis you plan to investigate
Create physical data conditions and metagenomic visualizations of data from two published cruises, Pabst and Outpace, that occurred in the North Atlantic and South Pacific, respectively. How do cyanobacteria from these locations differ in their protein expression, and does it correspond to environmental variables?

# Three sentence summary of the analysis you plan to do.
I will create visualizations to explain the scope and goals of this project, including maps of both sampling cruise locations and thermocline depth profiles. I will use the Biopython package to start my analysis of this data, including visualizing peptide counts found at cruise locations, visualizing sample data against existing scaffolds, and visualizing the prevalence of proteins of interest from the literature.
